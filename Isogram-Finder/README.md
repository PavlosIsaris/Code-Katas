# Isogram Finder

An isogram is a word in which no letter is repeated. Examples of isograms are uncopyrightable and ambidextrously. Conveniently, the word itself is an isogram.

Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.
