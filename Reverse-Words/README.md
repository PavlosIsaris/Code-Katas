# Reverse Words

## Introduction

You're working on a secret team solving coded transmissions.

Your team is scrambling to decipher a recent message, worried it's a plot to break into a major European National Cake Vault. The message has been mostly deciphered, but all the words are backward! Your colleagues have handed off the last step to you.

Write a method reverseWords() that takes a message as an array of characters and reverses the order of the words.

## Example

Input: `{'p', 'a', 'u', 'l'}`

Output: `{'l', 'u', 'a', 'p'}`
